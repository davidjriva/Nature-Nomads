# Nature-Nomads
I built an e-commerce platform using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Pug. The platform allows users to view tours of nature and inspect their details pages.  The page is fully functional as an e-commerce platform where users can create profiles, book tours with guides, and explore the world 🌎 ⛰️🌊🌲
